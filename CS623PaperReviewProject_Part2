I have taken an existing ER Diagram for a “paper reviews” database and implemented it in a relational database

There are few queries should return the following data (columns): Paper.Id, Paper.Title, Paper.Abstract, Author.EmailAddress,
Author.FirstName, Author.LastName
● Get all reviews for a paper by the paper’s Id, where the paper was recommended to be
published. The query should return the following data (columns): All columns from the
Review table.
● Get a count of all papers submitted.
● Create a new paper submission. Remember this includes creating new records in both
the Author and Paper tables.
● Try and Delete the first “Author” row in your Author table by the author’s id. Did you
receive an error? If yes, print to the console the error you received. Also note in your
message why the query failed. If it didn’t fail, print a message explaining why you were
able to delete the row

For above conditions i had created the tables for Authors, Reviewers, reviews, Paper,  

Following options will be given to the user 
1.Get paper details by author id
2.Get paper reviews by paper id
3.Get Number of papers submitted
4.Create new Paper submission
5.Delete Author by Author Id

If option 1 is selected "Papers that are submitted will display, by giving the author_Id"
If option 2 is selected "Reviews of Paper will display, by giving Paper_id"
If option 3 is selected "Number of papers that are submitted will be return"
If option 4 is selected "we can create a new paper using the Author's(First, last name), email address, Abstract of paper, title of paper, File name"
If option 5 is selected "we can delete the Author using AuthorId"

I had used "MYSQL" for database and the name of datbase is AuthorsDB.
By giving the credentials of MYSQL database in the code, we can connect to the database.
There are separate sections for each Options in the code which increases the readabilty and gives a clarity about the code modules.
